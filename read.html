<font  size="5" face="times new roman">Sericulture is an agro-based industry in a developing country like India, where there are lot of resources and labour. The industry is advantageous for the benefit of poor people in providing opportunities for the improvement of the rural livelihood. Sericulture has played a major role in the socio  economic life since 4000 years especially in occasions like marriages. Sericulture involves large scale of interdependent technologies from which useful by products will be evolved. Through the by- products and sericulture waste products, are used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, paper, agriculture and food industries. In addition to the production of silk, the industry can produce a number of by products from mulberry and silkworm. The conversion of sericulture waste into nutrient rich vermicompost by using the earthworms which can be recycled into organic manure is effective for soil fertility and crop production. The handicrafts are prepared by using the waste cocoons and silk having commercial value and   also used in several occasions. The waste and the by-products of mulberry and Sericulture  enhances the profit and sustainability of sericulture farmers and the industry in India.</font><br><br><br>

<font color="red" size="6">Introduction</font><BR>
<font size="5" face="times of new roman">Sericulture is an agro-based industry. It involves rearing of silkworms for the production of raw silk, which is the yarn obtained out of cocoons spun by certain species of insects. The major activities of sericulture comprises of food-plant cultivation to feed the silkworms which spin silk cocoons and reeling the cocoons for unwinding the silk filament for value added benefits such as processing and weaving. Although there are several commercial species of silkworms, Bombyx mori is the most widely used and intensively studied. According to Confucian texts, the discovery of silk production by B. mori dates to about 2700 BC, although archaeological records point to silk cultivation as early as the Yangshao period (5000 – 10,000 BCE). By the first half of the 1st century AD it had reached ancient Khotan, and by AD 140 the practice had been established in India. Later it was introduced to Europe, the Mediterranean and other Asiatic countries. Sericulture has become one of the most important cottage industries in a number of countries like China, Japan, India, Korea, Brazil, Russia, Italy and France. Today, China and India are the two main producers, together manufacturing more 90% the world production each year.</font><br><br>
<font color="red" size="6" face="times of new roman">What is Silk?</font><br>
<font  size="5" face="times of new roman">Man is always inquisitive for silk products. SILK - The Queen of Textiles, spells luxury, elegance, class and comfort. Mankind has always loved this shimmering fibre of unparalleled grandeur from the moment Chinese Empress Shiling Ti discovered it in her tea cup. It withstood many a daunting challenges from other natural and artificial fibres and yet, remained the undisputed Queen of Textiles since centuries. Exquisite qualities like the natural sheen, inherent affinity for dyes and vibrant colours, high absorbance, light weight, resilience and excellent drape etc. have made silk, the irresistible and inevitable companion of the eve, all over the world. Chemically speaking, silk is made of proteins secreted in the fluid state by a caterpillar, popularly known as 'silkworm'. These silkworms feed on the selected food plants and spin cocoons as a 'protective shell' to perpetuate the life. Silkworm has four stages in its life cycle viz., egg, caterpillar, pupa and moth. Man interferes this life cycle at the cocoon stage to obtain the silk, a continuous filament of commercial importance, used in weaving of the dream fabric.</font><br><br>
<font color="red" size="6">Why sericulture?</font><BR>
    <font  size="5" face="times of new roman"> The major benefit of the sericulture especially Tasar is the employment generation to the people specially in forest areas like tribal. Income from the forests leads to sense of protection and conservation of areas.<br> 
        1. High employment potential About 60-100 lakh persons are engaged in various sericulture activities in the country It is estimated that Sericulture can generate employment @ 11 man days per kg of raw silk production (in on-farm and off-farm activities) throughout the year. This potential is par-excellence and no other industry generates this kind of employment, specially in rural areas, hence, sericulture is used as a tool for rural economy upliftment . Provides vibrancy to village economies About 57 % of the gross value of silk fabrics flows back to the cocoon growers with share of income to different groups. 56.8 % to cocoon grower 6.8% to the reeler 9.1% to the twister 10.7% to the weaver 16.6% to the trade Thus, large chunk of income goes back to the villages from the cities. <br>
        2. Low Gestation, High Returns Mulberry takes only six months to grow for commencement of silkworm rearing. Mulberry once planted will go on

                <font size="5" face=""times new roman">supporting silkworm rearing year after year for 15-20 years depending on inputs and management provided. <br>
        3. Five crops can be taken in one year under tropical conditions. By adopting stipulated package of practices, a farmer can attain net income levels up to Rs.50000 per acre per annum. hardworking farmers with proper maintenance and inputs can reach up to an income of 2 lac per year from one acre.<br>
         4. Women friendly Occupation Women constitute over 60 % of those employed in down-stream activities of sericulture in the country. This is possible because sericulture activities starting from mulberry garden management, leaf harvesting and silkworm rearing is more effectively taken up by the women folk. Even silk reeling industry including weaving is 100% supported by them.<br>
         5. Ideal Program for Weaker Sections of the Society.<br>
         6. Sericulture can be practiced even with very low land holding. One acre of mulberry garden and silkworm rearing can support a family of five without hiring labour.<br>

        <font color="red" size="6" face="times new roman">Where do we find silk</font><br>
        <font size="5" face="times new roman">Geographically, Asia is the main producer of silk in the world and produces over 95 % of the total global output. Though there are over 40 countries on the world map of silk, bulk of it is produced in China and India, followed by Japan, Brazil and Korea. China is the leading supplier of silk to the world. India is the second largest producer of silk and also the largest consumer of silk in the world. It has a strong tradition and culture bound domestic market of silk. In India, mulberry silk is produced mainly in the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal, while the non-mulberry silks are produced in Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Orissa and north-eastern states. Silkworm larvae are fed mulberry leaves, and, after the fourth moult, climb a twig placed near them and spin their silken cocoons. The silk is a continuous-filament fiber consisting of fibroin protein, secreted from two salivary glands in the head of each larva, and a gum called sericin, which cements the two filaments together. The sericin is removed by placing the cocoons in hot water, which frees the silk filaments and readies them for reeling. The immersion in hot water also kills the silkworm pupae. Single filaments are combined to form thread. This thread is drawn under tension through several guides and wound onto reels. The threads may be plied together
            to form yarn. After drying the raw silk is packed according to quality.<br><br>
            </font>
            <font color="red" size="6" face="times new roman">Stages of Production</font><br>
            <font  size="5" face="times new roman">Though all four types of silkworms have different food plants and agro-climatic zone but the basic life cycle is almost the same. The stages of production are as follows: The silk moth lays eggs. When the eggs hatch, the caterpillars are fed food plants leaves. When the silkworms are about 25 days old, they are 10,000 times heavier than when they hatched. During the feeding period the silk worm goes 4 to five times in moth which is its property to shed its skin as it grows alarmingly fast in size. They are now ready to spin a silk cocoon. The silk is produced in two glands in the silkworm's head and then forced out in liquid form through openings called spinnerets. The silk solidifies when it comes in contact with the air. The silkworm spins approximately 0.8 Km to 1.5 km of filament and completely encloses itself in a cocoon in about two or three days.The silk is obtained from the undamaged cocoons by boiling the cocoon to find the outside end of the filament. The live pupa inside the cocoon dies due to boiling. The silk filaments are then wound on a reel. The silk at this stage is known as raw silk. In order to continue the life cycle not all cocoons are boiled and reeled. some good cocoons are preserved and the moth is allowed to come out and lay eggs so that the life cycles is continued for the next crop are season.</font><br><br>
            <font color="red" size="6" face="times new roman">Types of silk</font><br>
            <font  size="5" face="times new roman">There are four major types of silk of commercial importance, obtained from different species of silkworms which in turn feed on a number of food plants. These are: A. Classification based on species. All are different species.<br>
                1. Mulberry <br>
                2. Oak Tasar & Tropical Tasar <br>
                3. Muga <br>
                4. Eri<br>
                
                India produces all three varieties of natural silks viz silk, Tasar silk, Muga silk and Eri silk. The Tasar, Eri and Muga silk are non mulberry silks which are wild silks and also known as Vanya Silks.<br>
                Tasar: Though there is no recorded document available regarding the origin of tasar in India, one can find the mention of tasar silk in ancient epic Ramayana "Ram’s nuptial gift to Sita includes tasar silk". Temperate tasar is of recent origin and was introduced during mid 1960's.<br>
                Muga: The silk of Assam (Muga) was made known to the World during 1662 through a famous European traveller Jean Joseph Tavenier. Sericulture was exempted from payment of land revenue as the Kings of Assam patronized the development of sericulture. Around 1950, there was a great earth quake in Upper Assam and the large number of muga plantations was destroyed, which hampered the growth of muga industry.<br>
                Eri: The word Eri means castor plant, is derived from the word "eranda" of Sanskrit origin. The advent of Eri culture is lost into the antiquity but, the fact remains that Assam was the original home of Eri silk from time immemorial, with the earliest reference documented in 1779. The British called it as "Palma Christi" silk. The Eri silk was woven into heavy clothes known as "Bar Kapoor". Captain Jenkins (1771) remarked that Eri silk was of incredible durability.<br>
                Sericulture can be practiced even with very low land holding. One acre of mulberry garden and silkworm rearing can support a family of five without hiring labour.Features such as low gestation, high returns make sericulture an ideal program for weaker sections of the society.Vast tracts of forest based tasar food plantations available in the country, if judiciously exploited for rearing tasar silkworms, can offer supplementary gainful employment for tribals.

                <div class="centered"> Eco-friendly Activity.As a perennial crop with good foliage and root-spread, mulberry contributes to soil conservation and provides green cover. Waste from silkworm rearing can be recycled as inputs to garden. Dried mulberry twigs and branches are used as fuel in place of firewood and therefore reduce the pressure on vegetation/forest.  Being a labour intensive and predominantly agro-based activity, involvement of smoke-emitting machinery is minimal. Developmental program initiated for mulberry plantation are mainly in upland areas where un-used cultivable land is made productive. Mulberry can also be cultivated as intercrop with numerous plantations.Mulberry being a deep-rooted perennial plant can be raised in vacant lands, hill slopes and watershed areas.Currently, only about 0.1 % of the arable land in the country is under mulberry cultivation. Satisfies Equity Concerns Benefits of sectoral value-addition primarily accrue to rural households. As the end-product users are mostly from the higher economic groups, the money flows from high end groups to low end groups. Cases of landless families engaged in cocoon production using mulberry contracted from local farmers are common in some states. Mulberry farming is also done on community, government lands where the landless are given limited rights to cultivate mulberryAct 1980” a pollutant has been de¬fined as any solid, liquid or gaseous substance present in such concentration as may be or tend to be injurious to environment.

                <font size="5" face="times new roman">1. Evolution of appropriate cost-effective technologies through focused research projects addressing constraints and maximizing the production of quality eggs.<br>
                    2. Teaming up of sericulture scientists with molecular biologists, bio-engineers, immunologists, textile technologists, clinicians, experts from industry and a host of other stakeholders in charting out a new road map.<br>
                    3. Adoption of region and season specific approaches in the development of superior breeds / hybrids and feed package of practices.<br>
                    4. Establishment of close linkage between forward and backward sub-systems for greater efficiency and synergy as sericulture and silk industry is highly scattered and unorganized.<br>
                    5. Identification and promotion of potential clusters for Bivoltine and Vanya silk production in potential traditional and non-traditional areas.<br>
                    6. Skill up-gradation through structured and specially designed training programs. <br>
                   7. Establishment of linkages among the four identified production sub-systems viz., seed, cocoon, yarn and fabric.<br>
                    8. Capacity building for production and supply of adequate quality planting material, silkworm seed, reeling cocoons and silk yarn through promotion of largescale production units with required techno-financial support. <br>
                    9. Development and promotion of participatory extension system for effective adoption of technologies by similar stakeholders.<br>
                    10. Protection to some extent of Indian silk market from Chinese cheap raw silk and fabrics by implementation of anti-dumping duty. <br>
                   11. Effective utilization of by-products for value addition.
